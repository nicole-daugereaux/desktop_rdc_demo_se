# Simple Sauce Lab Examples
Very simple tests for Sauce Labs that don't require huge frameworks.

# Installing requirements
You may not need all the packages in the requirements file, but you can install them to your python like so (update the path as needed):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run command example:

```
python MultiRDC.py
```
or Python-version-specific:

```
python3 MultiRDC.py
```
